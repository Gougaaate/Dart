  ### Project Status
    
100%  
Functional simulations, real robot meets specifications 

  ### Work done
This README was written, and we got familiar with V-REP and git.
Set up a log display system.

Validation of our simulation, switch to real DART. Straight line mastered, as well as detection of walls in front of the robot. 
Use of the compass for the turns. 
Robot effective, it manages to correct its course and makes its turns using the compass.
